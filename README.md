## Neural Networks, Machine Learning and all that

Hi! Welcome to my page. I'm Shailesh, though chances are, if you are here, you know me already.

I work on Machine Learning applications in theoretical physics, and also in some aspects of ML theory.

I started life as a string theorist, you can read my papers  <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1065082">here</a>.

[Here](cifar10) is my first post: training an autoencoder on CIFAR-10
